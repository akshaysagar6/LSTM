what a king is this?\\n  ham. does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon\\nhe that hath kil'd my king, and whor'd my mother,\\npopt in betweene th' election and my hopes,\\nthrowne out his angle for my proper life,\\nand with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience,\\nto quit him with this arme? and is't not to be damn'd\\nto let this canker of our nature come\\nin further euill\\n\\n   hor. it must be shortly knowne to him from england\\nwhat is the issue of the businesse there\\n\\n   ham. it will be short,\\nthe interim's mine, and a mans life's no more\\nthen to say one: but i am very sorry good horatio,\\nthat to laertes i forgot my selfe;\\nfor by the image of my cause, i see\\nthe portraiture of his; ile count his fauours:\\nbut sure the brauery of his griefe did put me\\ninto a

waterflie?\\n  hor. no my good lord\\n\\n   ham. thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to\\nknow him: he hath much land, and fertile; let a beast\\nbe lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the kings\\nmesse; 'tis a chowgh; but as i saw spacious in the possession\\nof dirt\\n\\n   osr. sweet lord, if your friendship were at leysure,\\ni should impart a thing to you from his maiesty\\n\\n   ham. i will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; put\\nyour bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head\\n\\n   osr. i thanke your lordship, 'tis very hot\\n\\n   ham. no, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde is\\nnortherly\\n\\n   osr. it is indifferent cold my lord indeed\\n\\n   ham. mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my\\ncomplexion\\n\\n   osr. exceedingly, my lord, it is very soultry, as 'twere\\ni cannot tell how: but my lord, his maiesty bad me signifie\\nto you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head:\\nsir, this is the matter\\n\\n   ham. i beseech you remember\\n\\n   osr. nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:\\nsir, you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is at\\nhis weapon\\n\\n   ham. what's his weapon?\\n  osr. rapier and dagger\\n\\n   ham. that's two of his weapons; but well\\n\\n   osr. the sir king ha's wag'd with him six barbary horses,\\nagainst the which he impon'd as i take it, sixe french\\nrapiers and poniards, with their assignes, as girdle,\\nhangers or so: three of the carriages infaith are very\\ndeare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicate\\ncarriages, and of very liberall conceit\\n\\n   ham. what call you the carriages?\\n  osr. the carriages sir, are the hangers\\n\\n   ham. the phrase would bee more germaine to the\\nmatter: if we could carry cannon by our sides; i would\\nit might be hangers till then; but on sixe barbary horses\\nagainst sixe french swords: their assignes, and three\\nliberall conceited carriages, that's the french but against\\nthe danish; why is this impon'd as you call it?\\n  osr. the king sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene\\nyou and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits;\\nhe hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to\\nimediate tryall, if your lordship would vouchsafe the\\nanswere\\n\\n   ham. how if i answere no?\\n  osr. i meane my lord, the opposition of your person\\nin tryall\\n\\n   ham. sir, i will walke heere in the hall; if it please\\nhis maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let\\nthe foyles bee brought, the gentleman willing, and the\\nking hold his purpose; i will win for him if i can: if\\nnot, ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits\\n\\n   osr. shall i redeliuer you ee'n so?\\n  ham. to this effect sir, after what flourish your nature\\nwill\\n\\n   osr. i commend my duty to your lordship\\n\\n   ham. yours, yours; hee does well to commend it\\nhimselfe, there are no tongues else for's tongue\\n\\n   hor. this lapwing runs away with the shell on his\\nhead\\n\\n   ham. he did complie with his dugge before hee\\nsuck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same beauty\\nthat i know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of\\nthe time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of\\nyesty collection, which carries them through & through\\nthe most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow\\nthem to their tryalls: the bubbles are out\\n\\n   hor. you will lose this wager, my lord\\n\\n   ham. i doe not thinke so, since he went into france,\\ni haue beene in continuall practice; i shall winne at the\\noddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about\\nmy heart: but it is no matter\\n\\n   hor. nay, good my lord\\n\\n   ham. it is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of\\ngain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman\\n\\n   hor. if your minde dislike any thing, obey. i will forestall\\ntheir repaire hither, and say you are not fit\\n\\n   ham. not a whit, we defie augury; there's a speciall\\nprouidence in
